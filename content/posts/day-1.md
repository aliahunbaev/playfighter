Day one. Starting this 1000-day journey feels surreal. I'm 19, sitting in my room, and I've decided to document everything publicly as I build Combat Créatif and figure out what it means to create something meaningful.

The idea is simple: write every single day until September 2028. Not polished essays. Not content. Just raw thoughts on what I'm building, what I'm learning, what's hard.

Today I started by sketching out the first concepts for Combat Créatif's visual identity. There's something about combining martial arts philosophy with creative practice that feels right, but I can't quite articulate it yet. That's what these 1000 days are for.

I also built this site tonight. Minimal, timeless, just text and space. It's perfect.
