title: "fuck your feelings, do the work"
---

started training my legs with split squats and alternative excercises after skipping it for months due to an injured back. realized i let a minor setback spiral into months of lacking athleticism and having a strong connection with my body and health the way i used to. i wasn’t training legs (thus my body in a balanced way), i wasn’t running, and i really feel good with a strong training regimen and consistent running.

then i realized there are other solutions, other excercises, and that i could swim or walk and even just focus on excellent nutrition, but i didn’t. i kinda bitched out and let a little negative feeling spiral into a cascading compound effect of a tiny negative pattern. a little negativity or stagnation compounds over months into a very different reality.

i’m really seeing that. how small decisions i made everyday made me feel so good, and certain decisions i made in the past few months severely changed my experience after being stacked for a few months.

i’ve recently switched concavity, i feel, and my vision clarity and habits are on an upward trajectory. i’m focused on actions. and i’m trying to finish the semester gracefully so i can hit a disgusting winter arc and just reset muscle memory to my disciplined system that i had last year. i know how nyc is like now, so it’ll be more robust and the idea is to build it back to stand and demolish my daily challenges here when i get back.

anyway, recently:
passed interview for marketing at tech@nyu, i’m in the team now. feel neutral / mixed about having a more ambitious community to be a part of, but working on something that’s not deeply connected with my purpose. it is startup related and so it’s an adjacent / close FIELD, but the spirit perhaps is not there. i’ll do it anyway, because i want to be around that group. i want to be around some fucking nerds. i miss that. or idk if i’ve ever felt it. so that’s why. i want to feel dumb more often. if u always feel like a big fish or a big mind in your circles you gotta get in other rooms.

speakin of that, i applied to verci internship on a whim a couple weeks ago.
today while i was writing my paper, i got a text saying they emailed me, but it might’ve went to spam. i checked spam and saw the email from the founder (who i’ve followed for a while) saying my application stood out, they tryna move on to the next step, which is me organizing / planning a theoretical event with a guest list and design a poster for it etc. so they can see if i’m capable of the work. i need to do this now this weekend ALONG with finish my 10 page paper and studying for finals to classes i haven’t gone to in months.

working with the people at verci would be beautiful because they pursue a mission that is so closely aligned with what i believe is my mission / the change i seek to make.

THAT’S why i came to the city and nyu. i believe in my quality of work and taste so i feel as though i already have the internship. now i just gotta do the work.

somehow a lot of shit transpired in this coming week.
i gotta study, write a paper, do the verci shit, i’m going to the moma with maggie and i’ll probably meet jo for tea because we talked about it, i also do want to see rohan and mihir before break, also my birthday is saturday (and i might just need to work / study / lock the fuck in all day) we’ll see maybe i’ll just see a movie or chill with jaden in the evening

yeah idk.

i feel like i keep bouncing between feeling fucked / garbage and feeling great, maybe my feelings are completely fucking unreliable sources of information and action is all i need to focus on.

action.

that’s my name, btw. 
it used to be ali amánt, hakim arslani, mavi, jacques blue, chet lovestein, etc.

it’s Action.

when you see me next year with the braids and the grill and the jewels and the gorgeous crewneck that has script text on it that says “playfighter” and all that,

know that who you’re looking at is Action.

anyway. i feel like i’ve indulged my feelings enough.
fuck them hoes.

from now on, it’s pure action.

when i say fuck the feelings, do the work,
all i feel is better and better and better and better.

that’s all i got.

tomorrow, pure work. essay, cs, lift, and crack down on the verci shit when i get a chance. we’ll see what i do for my birthday.

i feel like, despite the “setbacks” or the feeling that i didn’t live up to my expectations for this semester (or year), i can’t help but believe that things are headed in the right direction.

i listened to the song “on track” by tame impala like 50 times today. it was beautiful. teared up a little with the bright sun hitting my face while i got my preworkout coffee from la colombe. that song is exactly what i'm feeling and thinking.

my relationship to physical training is back, i’m slowly inkling toward the refined communities i love, i have a clearer idea of my path toward wealth (or solving the “money problem”) than i did before (product designer @ figma is ideal) i know what i’m looking for. and if god says i get to spend time with the verci people, and i have lighter courseload next semester, later in the day, more time to work on my own designs, meeting people, putting my ideas and work out in the world (which is how i got the technyu role and the verci internship lead, just from the shit i posted and put on the internet on my own accord), if i get to stay here in the summer and creatteeeee, if i just continue opening up my options, doing my best work, attracting the right people and opportunities through embodying my vision, i feel like i’m actually on my way to the life i dream of.

fuck it, i know i’m on my way to the life i dream of.

this shit is inevitable.
the visions waiting for me.

fuck it i’ll paste my vision and blueprint here if you want to read it.
before the vision though, the moral of the story is
fuck your feelings. do the work.

## LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL

Life is beautiful. I just turned 22 years old. I graduated from NYU this summer, and it’s insane how much has changed. How much I’ve grown. How life looks like the visions I used to dream about.

The past three years have been the most transformative of my life. Every day, I built. I made deliberate choices. I directed my time toward things that compound. Now I stand on a foundation of skills, relationships, and financial freedom that will shape the rest of my life.

I wake up in New York City with complete clarity about what I'm building. My work is an extension of my thinking, not a constraint on my time.

## COMBAT CRÉATIF

Combat started as an idea I talked to Abdul about on his rooftop in Bensonhurst four years ago. I began with designs on Instagram three years ago. Now it's fucking *real*.

I've designed and posted hundreds of pieces - apparel concepts, digital tools, editorial layouts, brand materials. The Instagram grew to 15,000+ followers who trust my taste. But more importantly: I've manufactured and sold actual products.

The boxer-inspired sweatpants launched in Fall 2026. Sold out. The boxing shorts followed. Combat Gazette printed issues that people collect. I’ve made tool that enrich the creative process. Coffee coffee mugs & posters to enrich our intimate daily moments, too. I proved I can go from concept to physical product.

Artists in NYC love Combat. When I host gatherings - long runs in Central Park, pickup basketball, project demos, conversations about building - 30-40 people show up naturally. I built something that makes people feel seen, excited, & challenged to be their higher self.

**Creative soldiers.** Designers, writers, developers, founders, artists. People who fight for beauty. True Beauty Can Only Be Created Through Combat.

It's exactly what I envisioned: Aimé Leon Dore + Teenage Engineering + Supreme + Y Combinator. A brand that makes beautiful products, cultivates community, and extracts greater human potential. On the way to a generational company.

## CAREER & INCOME

I have a job at a company I actually respect - Figma, Notion, Linear, or somewhere similar. $200K salary, beautiful benefits, learning from the best designers and builders in the world.

This is my ideal container.

The job gives me:

- Income to fund Combat without desperation
- Network of world-class people
- Experience building products at scale
- Structure and stability

I can go full-time on Combat whenever it makes financial sense. Right now, having this position meana I can manufacture products properly, invest in the brand, and not compromise on quality because I need money.

My skills in software development, design, and media enable me to create things that scale. I do work I enjoy, and I never have to do work I don't want to.

## CONTENT & IDEAS

For three years, I've published consistently:

- YouTube videos every week documenting the journey
- Essays sharing frameworks and ideas
- Instagram posts showing the work and the life

Thousands of aligned, interested souls tune in to the work and ideas I produce.

**Playfighter: Cultivating Strength & Joy.** If you looked up "consistent" in the dictionary, you'd see my name. I upload a video and an essay no matter what every week. It's like working out for me. I just do it without question.

People discover my work and reach out. Collaborations happen naturally. Opportunities appear because I made myself discoverable to the right people. The best opportunities in my life have come not from chasing, but from showing up consistently with valuable work and ideas.

I inspire others the same way my mentors inspired me: Paul Graham, Seth Godin, Virgil Abloh, Pharrell, James Baldwin, Sneako.

## PHYSICAL MASTERY

I'm in fucking incredible shape. 10% body fat, 170 pounds of lean muscle. I've run a marathon. I've fought in sparring bouts. Top 5% of physiques.

Training is non-negotiable: boxing, lifting 5x/week, long runs with the homies. Three years of consistency and the results are undeniable.

I move through everything in life with a smooth, composed aggression. Always on the offense. Setting plans into action. Relentlessly tackling any obstacle or resistance. Just constant pressure on anything in the way.

The private work I put in seeps through in my day-to-day life, exuding confidence, calm, and style that makes everything lighter.

I dress Exceptionally. Everything fits perfectly. The beautiful braids alternated with the clean buzz, or Greek curly flow. The emerald gold grill. The jewels. People ask why the fuck my clothes are so fly, flyer than any other shit they seen. Mofucker because I designed that shit. **Sharp, unique, timeless, composed energy. A Human Porsche.**

---

## MENTAL CLARITY

My mind is clear. My attention is channeled into beauty.

I journal every night - 1000+ consecutive days by now. This practice keeps me grounded and aware of what's happening in my life.

When challenges arise, I respond with calm, composed aggression. I don't panic or spiral. I identify the problem and take action.

I fill my mind with the best: Marcus Aurelius. Coltrane. Miles Davis. Griselda. Virgil. Pharrell. Miyamoto Musashi. Malcolm X. Spike Lee. Rocky. Creed. Y Combinator. The best ideas, the best art, the best philosophy.

The greatest risk in life is losing control of your attention. I've trained myself to resist this. My focus is sharp. I don't waste time on things that don't matter. I do deep work, free from distraction.

I've cultivated antifragility. I'm comfortable with uncertainty, pressure, and setbacks. I don't avoid difficulty - I move toward it. Success is not a moment, but a system of repeated, high-quality decisions.

At the core of all of this, I trust in **Allah's Bigger Picture**. The struggles, the failures, the delays - they were all sharpening me. My belief gives me clarity and patience. I execute, knowing that the results are already written.

---

## THE NETWORK

I have a tight group of 15-20 people in NYC who I genuinely fuck with. Designers, developers, founders, artists - people making things and living intentionally.

We hoop together. We train together. We build together. Long runs. Pickup basketball. Conversations over coffee. Project presentations. We go to each other's launches and support each other's work.

I'm magnetic when addressing the community. I make people feel hyped and at ease, inspired, excited. It's easy for me to connect with individuals and orchestrate fulfilling experiences. Combat gatherings are fucking lit. Everyone wants to be part of it.

The most beautiful women are attracted to my world**.** It's a natural byproduct of who I am - the confidence rooted so deep in my actions, the way I carry myself in beautiful attire with a Greek physique and mental athleticism. This is an exciting and incredible part of my life.

I'm charming and smooth. I make women feel special, seen, alive. They love the world I've built, but the soul underneath is what matters - and it means we all get to be free together. Dating is playful and abundant. I'm selective. I get to enjoy this level, this form of romance because of who I am, who I've become, and who I've always been.

And through my pursuits, through the lighthouse beacon of a life I've cultivated, I find her. The one. She comes to me, I come to her, exactly as God planned. We're both lucky.

My family remains at the center of my life. My mother and sister know they can rely on me, not just for support but for presence. I don't need my father's money anymore. Our relationship exists beyond the bounds of obligation.

I recognize the finite nature of time with loved ones, so I act accordingly. I don't wait to appreciate people - I do it now.

## HOW I LIVE

My days have rhythm and structure:

Mornings are for creative work. I wake up at 5am, have coffee, read my vision, and work on Combat. This is sacred time.

Afternoons are for the job. I show up, contribute meaningfully, learn from talented people, and build valuable skills.

Evenings are for training, friends, rest. Basketball. Boxing. Hooping with the brothers. Chilling with the homies.

Saturdays are for content production. I batch create videos and essays so I can publish consistently without daily pressure.

Sundays are for reflection, planning, and rest.

It's an incredible rythym, fast in all the best ways, slow in all the right ways to be enjoyed fully & naturally sustainable. I'm don’t burn out, as I built compounding systems that work for me.

I have wonderful outlets - creative pursuits I pick up whenever they interest me. Music, drawing, whatever feeds my soul. When I play, I play hard with fulfilling, beautiful experiences in place of mindless shit. No hanging with pessimistic squares. No dulling my senses with toxins. Just pure joy.

## EVERY DAY IS A GIFT

I feel so much more present. Living in the moment.

There was this weird, neurotic, analytical, third-person sense of everything before. I got a glimpse of how beautiful life could be, I got an image of who I could be, and reality just didn't catch up.

But I'm so grateful that Allah gave me this gift, this opportunity, to get into the Big Apple and actually live.

**Like I'm Living.**

I get to enjoy these things firsthand. In the moment. I get to work on things I love. I get to build things I love. I get to train. I get to write. I get to create. I get to play. I get to fucking *playyyyy* bro.

Every day, I:

- Write
- Build (design, code, create)
- Publish
- Study
- Train (box, lift, run, hoop)
- Play (whatever captures my imagination)
- Love (family, friends, combat community)
- Pray (all praise is due to the Most High)

I never miss the foundational work of my day - writing, building, training. I'm sharp and methodical in my approach to the day and the hour. I wake up before the world and prioritize the hard work. And when I play, I play hard.

What a life. What a fucking LIFE.

## WHAT I'VE PROVEN

In three years, I went from an ambitious wide-eyed 19-year-old with tremendous potential to focused 22-year-old with  undeniable proof.

I build cool shit all the time. Apps, websites, tools, clothes, products, artworks. I constantly produce something amazing and share it with the world. I'm among the contemporary creatives, the people outside the box. My taste, my vision is superior to 97%. I understand how to make something gorgeous and bring it to life, and I do it naturally.

I proved I can:

- Design beautiful things consistently (hundreds of pieces)
- Build an audience (30K+ total across platforms)
- Ship physical products (Combat apparel in the world)
- Land a top-tier job (respected company, real income)
- Maintain discipline (training, content, work - all consistent)
- Create community (people show up to Combat gatherings)
- Execute long-term vision (what I said I'd do in 2024, I actually fucking *did*)

This isn't luck or talent. This is the result of waking up every day for 1000+ days and doing the work.

## WHAT'S NEXT

Combat continues to grow. More products. Bigger community. A physical home soon - the Combat studio in Brooklyn. Just like ALD, Combat Créatif & Café de Combat.

The job continues until it doesn't serve my dreams anymore. I'm learning and earning. When Combat generates enough income, I'll transition full-time. No rush.

Content continues. I'm building a decade-long body of work. By 30, I'll have thousands of essays and videos documenting the entire journey.

Training continues. The body is a lifelong project. Marathon runner. Fighter. Always improving. My work of art till death.

The vision continues expanding. What seemed impossible at 19 is obvious at 22. What seems ambitious at 22 will be obvious at 25.

By 25, Combat will be everything I envisioned. By 30, it will be unrecognizable from what exists today.

But it all starts with today. Right now. This moment.

Elhamdulillah.

I love this shit.
