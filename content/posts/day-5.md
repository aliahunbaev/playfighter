in my experience, to win, you need two things.

VISION: what you want, exactly written out. 3-5 years from now.

BLUEPRINT: what to do to become that. as specific and clarifying as you can get it to be.

and read them every morning. update as needed. never let these two rot.
woke up depressed, (you need purpose and vision to wake up excited to do shit. at least i do)
realized i need my vision and blueprint clear again,
spent like 4 hours writing my vision and blueprint with revisions from the past three months, it was dope as fuck and that shit makes a huge difference.
in my experience, to win, you need two things.



then i interviewed for technyu, i didn't know it was an interview till they started interviewing me,
i realized how true it is that you attract things in this world, it's so much better to operate that way than to chase.
i posted my work on insta, haley found me and invited me to a technyu meeting,
i went and spoke with her about what i'm into
two months later, the executive board needs someone who designs and makes videos for startup week, haley recommends me, and they text me asking me to interview,
i join the call and just talk about shit i'm into and what i do,
and i get the role in this club.
it's mfs out here CHASING roles, CHASING resume lines CHASING acceptance, when you can just use your own creativity and DEMONSTRATE your capability, and that is so much better "networking" than jerking mfs off over coffee chats and cold emails (coffee chats are fun though i enjoy conversations. but only because i'm an interesting person and i'm INTERESTED and the other person is interesting and interested as well. zero performance. purely being the maximum version of myself.)

i went to the city and got coffee with jaden,
gave jaden a copy of the practice by seth godin,
then i worked on my paper,
got shawarma with jaden,
went home,
and slept.


i'll paste my vision and blueprint links here if you want to read.
