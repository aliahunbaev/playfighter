title: "failure"

i'm flying back to chicago in a few hours.
i believe this semester was a failure
for example, just got my grades back. first c+ i've ever gotten in my life. b+ in another. could've easily gotten 4.0 AND got insane progress in all my goals if i made better decisions.

the main cause can be attributed to being soft

what does that mean?

- making decisions based on feelings
- allowing too much shit to slide - associating with the wrong people, staying up late, letting work slide / get postponed

as a result, i have basically existed as a loser for the majority / average of the semester.

i am deeply disturbed and angry.

i know what to do.

in the following weeks, during break, i will focus on revising & training these parts of my mind.

and safe to say i will not exhibit the same habits, people i associate with, and the "flowy" approach of things. that is how 97% move

and i don't feel good.

i don't feel like myself.

never again.
