title: "combat créatif direction"

i'm a writer.

so i wake up every day and i write for 1 hour, roughly.

just to have some space to let my mind exhale, see what i'm working with, see what the agenda is.

i'll focus my mind this morning on combat créatif. serving the creative soldiers, who serve the muse, or the art. people who care about making a creative contribution. people like us. people who like beautiful design, hip hop, and french cinema. people who like metaphors about their work and making things feel magical. people who like clothes that have stories and serve an emotional purpose, people who like using interesting tools and creating challenges and making things and meeting other people who like making things.

i spent last week watching some of paul rand's interviews and videos, reading his booklet for next, and focusing on trying to make something like that. i ended up rebranding combat, combat new york, or combat ny to combat créatif, combát. to me, this differentiates the company - the name is unused, i secured @combatcreatif, and i will secure combatcreatif.com soon as well.

what does it mean?

well it's in the name.

just like beau flaneur was, and i'm just excited to explore that direction as well. i missed the aesthetic and philosophical sensibilities of beau flaneur, which was a huge impetus to my exploration of expanding the name and domain of combat. now when i say or think of the name combat créatif, or combát, i think about the images that i love. and it widens.

but what do i want to work on with that?

brand identity and visual aesthetic, paul rand logo book, a design system, combatcreatif.com, @combatcreatif social aesthetic/format, small intimate gatherings where people share their work, musical curation of songs speeches movie lyrics and live spinning of great sounds with jaden. speaking, doing art with an audience of people. whatever it was with jaden in the c3 mini theater when we began to speak, and it felt fun. like writers week. like mae.

the communities i liked going to so far were the mae / columbia group, index nyc, entrepreneur's exchange (which i should apply to join next semester maybe), and yeah. technyu. but for some reason, i'm a bit institution averse. also, at this point i just want to work on my own vision in my head so i don't want to go to these events too much. i feel like i'd need to develop more work first, and then show up in these spaces not as a chill guy but as the designer and director of combát.

yeah the community / people thing is a bit strange, there's a little tension there, because on one hand i feel as though i should be going to more things joining more things, on the other hand filling my cup deeply includes creative work, which i want to spend more time doing so that i can show up as my actual self in the world, expressed and realized and differentiated.

but what would it mean to "have work"?

to have a brand, a beautiful website, a clear purpose of what it is that we do and the change i seek to make, a magnet for that change, and perhaps a few offerings. so just to start off, how i imagine it could go, is to create a beautiful and compelling brand, with clearly dope visuals and philosophy, website, etc. then to make a few key offerings which are targeted to people like abdul, me, jaden, etc.

something like a creative uniform (soldat créatif hoodie), playfighter crewneck, studio tee, gym wife beater, soldat sketchbook, "true beauty" sketchbook or journal. a replicable 1000 days journaling challenge software code, blueprint to plan a creative project, palette to collect inspiration and moodboards (like pinterest but better, but cosmos is that) but honestly, idk where software fits into combat. it might just be manifested as a dope website.

the rest of this blog will be a compacted version of my conversation with Claude (AI)

## the seth godin question

i've been thinking about seth godin's framing: specific change for specific people. in my head i have the brand name and ethos - combat créatif, serving creative soldiers, making their lives better. the ways i can think of doing this are through beautiful products, useful tools or software for the creative process, and gatherings irl for artists.

i feel impostor syndrome about the gatherings until products or social media gather interest and the eyes of those people. but i wonder what direction to actually move in first, or how to think about it, or if i should just try all of them.

and what clicked: "specific change for specific people" doesn't mean solving one narrow problem. it means knowing who notices when you're not there. right now that's more like people who want to wear something that represents creative ambition than creative professionals who need productivity software.

i see this duality, this overlap of philosophical psychological existential struggle, discipline, the audacity to share your voice, with the beauty and change we see in the world. james baldwin, steven pressfield, hip hop, jazz, greek statues. people who see it like that. and products that carry that depth. so the offerings are products - clothes, magazines, sketchbooks, jewelry, journals. things that spread the idea, the world. then gatherings, little things in the city to meet people and talk. but starting with products.

## what combat actually is

combat is a philosophical stance made physical. not productivity tools for creatives. physical things that represent a worldview about creative struggle and beauty. clothes, magazines, sketchbooks, jewelry, journals all make sense because they live in someone's daily life as reminders of who they're trying to be.

baldwin, pressfield, jazz, greek statues - it's not random. it's about discipline, excellence, the spiritual dimension of making things. people who get it will recognize it immediately.

products first makes sense. each thing is functional and emblematic. someone wearing a combat hoodie or writing in a combat journal isn't just using a product, they're signaling alignment. that's how i find my people before gathering them.

magazines and posters spread the idea faster because they're cheaper to make and easier to share. they establish the foundation. then wearables and objects are how people join.

## what happens next

next 90 days: make one product, probably the sweats with the branded waistband - distinctive, wearable, carries the whole thing. and one piece of media, a zine/lookbook hybrid, that says what combat is. the product gets worn. the media gets shared. both pull in the right people. then gatherings happen naturally because i know who to invite since they already bought in.

not trying three directions. building one thing that expresses itself multiple ways.

## why products then tools then gatherings

products, tools, gatherings - they're not competing. they're stages. products get attention and money. attention lets me host gatherings. gatherings show me what tools matter. tools create deeper community. it's a cycle.

products first because i can make them alone, they prove the brand exists, they generate feedback, they fund everything else.

software feels too early. not because i can't build it, but because i haven't established authority or understanding of creative workflows that'd make people trust my solution. figma came from people who deeply understood design tools. i'm 19, three months into nyc. i don't have that depth yet in that domain.

but products i can do. products get me into someone's closet in the next 90 days. that's the move.

## playfighter vs combat

playfighter is my thoughts, emotions. i feel and see and think about so much, i need somewhere to put it. to make videos about my life and what i see. the real audience can look through my instagram youtube blog and see how it's lived.

combat is the studio. the manifestation. but someone sees it and they see a world of beauty, not ali's story.

playfighter is the engine - my perspective, unfiltered, documenting seeing and thinking. exists whether anyone watches or not because i need it.

combat is the distillation - the aesthetic universe someone enters without knowing me. they engage with the philosophy made real. playfighter's there if they want to go deeper. but combat stands alone.

## the instagram situation

combat's instagram has 2,100 followers and 38 posts. not starting from zero. quotes, moodboards, the point of view exists.

about 1,000 people unfollowed since abdul left and we started posting again. about 200-300 new people followed since then. losing followers made me feel bad but that's the wrong thing to watch. the 200-300 who followed are my people. they found combat and stayed because they got it.

combat is about the philosophy. the philosophy is the brand. products are one expression of it. if i strip away the curation to become a clean brand page with clothes, i kill what makes it interesting.

someone buys a combat hoodie that says soldat créatif because they feel that creative work is combat. that making things takes discipline and courage. not because it's a nice hoodie. because it represents what they believe.

so instagram stays as that pulse - philosophy, inspiration, worldview. when products exist, they show up as extensions of the thinking, not the main thing.

curation isn't secondary to products. curation is the product until physical products exist. and after they exist, curation gives them meaning.

## the first launch

one product and one piece of media as the first statement of combat créatif.

the product is the boxer/artist sweats with the big branded waistband. distinctive, recognizable, boxing gear reference ties to the combat metaphor. says this is about the practice, the daily grind, the uniform when you're actually working. functional and philosophical.

the media is a hybrid zine/lookbook. physical and digital.

8-12 pages with a cover that's clean and bold, an opening statement of one page saying what combat créatif is and what it means to be a creative soldier, the manifesto. then 4-6 pages of friends wearing the sweats in real life - working, walking, creating. documentary, not fashion. then 1-2 pages of philosophy, design breakdown, baldwin and pressfield quotes, my writing about creative practice. and a product page with a simple shot, details, how to buy.

pdf on combatcreatif.com free to download. print 25-50 copies for first orders or to give friends. post spreads on combat's ig before launch.

and a 5-8 min playfighter video showing the process - designing, shooting the lookbook, what combat means. lives on my channel, drives people to combat.

they launch together. media gives the product depth. product gives media reality. someone sees the zine or video and thinks i want in and there's something to buy right there.

product isn't just merch. media isn't empty philosophy. two halves of one statement.

## timeline

next 8 days are finals. no moves on combat.

winter break is the real window. finalize sweats design. find manufacturers. get samples or first run. shoot lookbook with friends. write the copy. design the zine. document everything for playfighter youtube.

launch sometime in spring. i think 2-3 drops spring semester would be dope, or one in the summer too when i'm here. product live, zine drops, youtube video.

making beautiful shit with my friends in nyc, documenting my truth on playfighter, packaging it clean through combat.


note: these are my thoughts / takeaways from brainstorming this morning, talking to claude. just for a glimpse of where my heads at, these ideas will likely be explored deeper and refined.
