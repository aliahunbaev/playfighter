title: "art saves me"
---

elhamdulillah beautiful day.

i'm just working on combat's web design.

i want this company to be something that leaves you feeling strong & hopeful.

because that is the only perception we can have of ourselves if we want a more beautiful world.

we must believe in our strength and have hope.

i want everyone who engages with my work to understand that it is not about taking anything from them, the point of the business is not TO TAKE, (money, attention, time) but rather to GIVE them something which is worth much more than whatever resources they'd have to expend to engage.

so yeah that's what i have in mind as i build it.

listening to malcolm x, james baldwin, nikki giovanni, beautiful speakers.

art saves me.

i hope i can use it in such a way that art can save others too.
