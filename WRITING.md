# Writing Guide

## Daily Writing Practice

Every day, create a new markdown file in `content/posts/` following this pattern:

### Filename
`day-N.md` where N is the day number (day-1.md, day-2.md, etc.)

### Frontmatter
```markdown
---
date: "Month DD, YYYY"
---
```

The date field is the only required frontmatter. Title is optional.

### Content Guidelines

**Length**: 150-500 words typically. But write what feels right.

**Format**:
- Write naturally
- Use **bold** for emphasis
- Use *italics* for softer emphasis
- Use > for blockquotes if needed
- Keep paragraphs readable (3-5 sentences max)

**Tone**:
- Raw, not polished
- Honest, not performative
- Process, not product
- "If you know you know" energy

### What to Write About

- What you built today
- What you learned
- What you struggled with
- Insights about Combat Créatif
- Philosophical thoughts
- Creative process observations
- Technical challenges
- Personal growth

### What NOT to Write

- Don't write for engagement
- Don't write for likes
- Don't write to impress
- Don't sanitize your thoughts
- Don't wait for perfect prose

## Example Post Structure

```markdown
---
date: "December 5, 2025"
---

[Opening thought or observation - what's on your mind?]

[What you did today - 2-3 paragraphs]

[What you learned or realized]

[Optional: What's next or an open question]
```

## Publishing

1. Create your markdown file in `content/posts/`
2. Save it
3. The site automatically picks it up
4. Commit to git and deploy

No build step needed during development. Just write and refresh.

## Tips

- Write immediately after working, while thoughts are fresh
- Set a timer for 10 minutes if you're stuck
- Don't edit too much - first draft energy is good
- Let some posts be short (100 words is fine)
- Let some posts be long (1000 words is fine too)
- Consistency > perfection

---

The goal is 1000 posts. One per day. No exceptions.
